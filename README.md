# CaseStudy
This repository consists of the code for the Data Challenges (Case Studies or Workshops) posted in SuperDataScience Website. Few of all the case studies have been attempted to be solved. Each folder represents each case study which was posted in the website. Every folder contains the description of the problem in Description.md file, the pdf copy of the question as posted in the website, dataset and the code for the data challenge along with a final report (.Rmd file) that has explanation for each step in the code.

# NOTE: THE ENTIRE DATASET HAS NOT BEEN ANALYZED. ONLY THE QUESTIONS IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED. ONE CAN TRY TO RESOLVE THE ENTIRE DATASET BY THEMSELVES.
